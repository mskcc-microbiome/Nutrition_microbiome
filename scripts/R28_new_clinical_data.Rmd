Date ranges:

Blood Cx: Days 0 to 100

ALC: Day -365 to 365

CD4: Day -365 to 365


Caveats â€“

Blood Cx: working on a more robust tool to pull out cleaned names for species isolates from the culture reports. Right now, done with simple Regex. Result2 column contains additional bugs if identified.

CD4: I am still trying to hunt down all the different assays we use to describe CD4+ cells, this one is just using the most popular assay I could identify for absolute CD4 quantification.

# Immune reconstitution

```{r}
# For the ALC and CD4 data, the uln of 3.2 means that a result above 3.2 would be considered higher than normal. However, in the context of BMT patients who are recovering from zero, the primary focus is on seeing the result_value increase towards the normal range. The ULN is just there for completeness.

# A standard and easily defensible choice would be to match each stool sample with the closest lab draw within a +/- 2 day window.

# For a stool sample collected on sdrt = 5, you would look for any ALC/CD4 measurements taken on days 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
# 
# If there are multiple lab draws in that window, you would typically use the one that is closest in time to the stool sample.
