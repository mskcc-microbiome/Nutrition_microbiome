### How to Interpret the Output:
# In the printed summary, look for the "Fixed effects" table.
# Find the row for the interaction term, which will be labeled something like:
# `TreatmentE. faecalis + Sucrose Water:Time_h`
# The p-value for this term (in the `Pr(>|t|)` column) is your answer.

#
# - If p > 0.05: This means you do not have enough evidence to conclude that the
#   growth rates are different. p = 0.6476, during the initial 48-hour window, the growth patterns are statistically indistinguishable.

# the interaction term (Treatment:experiment_no) is actually testing: "Did the effect of sucrose water depend on which experiment it was in?"
# not the question I am interested in but it is good to confirm that whatever effect (or lack of effect) the sucrose had, it was the same in both of your independent experiments. This demonstrates that your experimental system is reproducible.
# Because the interaction is not significant, it is statistically valid to remove that term from the model and look at the simpler "main effects" model (which is what you had before). This gives you more power to detect a true effect of the Treatment itself.
